## Pill Tracker
This is a small project which reminds user to take their pills via notification and track their response.

Usually, it becomes a problem for anyone to remember if they have taken their pill on a particular day or not. The usual alarms that we have on mobile will only be able remind you to take the pill, but it won't record your response.

This is project tries to solve that problem by providing users a link to use, if they have taken their medicine along with the reminder. When user hits it, system will record their response and store in the database. At the end of the week, fortnight, month - you will get a report which will help you understand your pill intake.
